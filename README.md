# ErcotMonitor

I was inspired to create this bot in early 2022 when the electrical grid in Texas had been and would continue experiencing collapses or near misses:

Even recently and not in winter months, the grid often comes close to collapse:

It also can provide visual, numerical, and easy historical tracking of the values made public by ERCOT, listed by typing "!ercot" in a Discord server channel.

The bot also provides warnings when the frequency of the grid approaches a dangerous level.

I'm currently working on adding more analytical tools and customization and not worrying about whether the power will go out.
